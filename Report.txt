This is an Inventory Management web application designed using Redis database.
A Customer can place orders selecting vendors of their preference. 
Once registered as a customer you can login through the login page and place your order.
Your data will be automatically stored inside Redis database once you have successfully registered as a customer, same goes for the vendor. 
To see the data in the database type "keys *" in Redis-cli. 
Remember to close Redis-cli before registering a new customer/vendor. This may cause an error while registering. 
Registered customer/vendor's contact number is the main key that we have used. 
To get any data let say customer name from the database type this command "get cust_names:cont_no:cust_name" this returns the name of the registered customer.
